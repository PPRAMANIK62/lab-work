3. **✅ Ask users what project they want to work on**
   - ✅ Created main CLI that supports both Francis Turbine and Pelton Wheel
   - ✅ Added interactive mode to choose between calculators
   - ✅ Added list command to show available calculators
   - ✅ Removed dependency on running only francis-turbine by default

4. **✅ Code splitting and modular architecture**
   - ✅ Split monolithic files into focused modules
   - ✅ Created shared utilities for constants, validation, and formatting
   - ✅ Organized calculators into separate directories with clear separation
   - ✅ Kept all files under 80 lines for maintainability
